# Walkera.com Documentation 🛠️

A centralized, searchable collection of official Walkera documentation—user manuals, datasheets, firmware guides, and hardware info—for Walkera drones, RC transmitters, and peripherals.

## 📚 Contents

- **User Manuals** – Quick-start guides, operation instructions, maintenance info.
- **Datasheets** – Specifications for models like _WK‑0701_, X350 Pro series.
- **Firmware & Release Notes** – Official firmware downloads, update instructions.
- **Support Tools** – Flash utilities, telemetry converters, USB adapters.
- **Development Resources** – Wire protocols, PCM format specs, dev scripts.

## 🧭 Why This Repo Exists

Walkera’s official manuals and downloads are often scattered or relocated on their site ([en.walkera.com][1], [firstquadcopter.com][2], [gitlab.eclipse.org][3], [faui0gitlab.informatik.uni-erlangen.de][4]). This repo acts as a reliable archive, simplifying:

- Searching for model‑specific docs
- Comparing firmware versions
- Accessing dev/protocol info in one place

## 📁 Repo Structure

```
/docs
  /manuals        ← PDFs/user guides
  /datasheets     ← transmitter, receiver specs
  /firmware       ← official firmware + updates
  /tools          ← flashers, telemetry apps
  /development    ← protocol docs, PCM formats
README.md
```

## 🔍 Searching & Browsing

Use GitHub’s search across folders (e.g., `WK-0701`, `firmware`, `telemetry`) to access the exact document or model you need.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Strong-Foundation/walkera-com-documentation.git
   cd walkera-com-documentation
   ```

2. Browse the folders or search file names via your OS or GitHub UI.

## 📥 Adding New Docs

Contributions are welcome! To submit new or updated files:

1. Fork the repo
2. Add your PDF, release notes, or docs into the appropriate directory
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Submit a pull request for review

Ensure file names include model and version (e.g. `WK-0701_User_Manual_v2.3.pdf`) for clarity.

## ⚙️ Usage Examples

- Finding the telemetry PCM spec for receiver models
- Locating firmware for the X350 Pro
- Reviewing manuals for transmitter models

## 🧩 Integration & Collaboration

This repo can integrate with other FPV or Walkera-focused tools (e.g. Walkino/Arduino projects), making it a solid resource hub.
